Marathon QT2 Tracks

These recordings provide authentic Marathon music circa 1994.

ABOUT:

The recordings included with M1A1 were made using QuickTime 2.5. However, QuickTime 2.5 came out after Marathon, and changed the sound of the tracks slightly.

These WAV files were made from digital audio recordings of a Mac running QuickTime 2.0, the version of QuickTime bundled with the initial Marathon release. Short of owning a classic Mac, this is as close as you can get to the authentic 1994 audio experience.


CREDITS:

The recordings were made by Hopper, with technical assistance from Treellama. Thanks to Hamish Sinclair, Craig Hardgrove, and everyone else at the Story forum who helped make these recordings happen.

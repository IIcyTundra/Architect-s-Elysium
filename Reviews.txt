I thought the game was really good and it took a lot of effort, probably the best game I've reviewed so far.
I can't really find anything negative about the game either, so good job!


Skyler Miller: When I initially opened the game I was very impressed. The artstyle is great, the 3D environment is cool, and the fact that you changed the icon for the build is cool as well. The first plus is that everything seemed to work smoothly on my widescreen monitor. I do find it a bit confusing on how much damage I am doing or where my bullet is going. It would be nice to have bullet impact effects. Because of this, I found the easiest way to kill enemies to walk right up to them and shoot twice. They didn't do enough damage to make me worry about taking damage at all. Also it may be better to allow enemies to fall off of ledges because they did get stuck up there sometimes when trying to chase me. When I defeated all the enemies and returned to the main menu, my mouse wasn't anywhere on screen and I couldn't press any buttons. So I had to alt-f4 and open the game again if I wanted to replay. Overall this is a very impressive project and I had a fun time. (Prototype Build)
